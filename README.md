# Internal-Fluid-Flow-for-Scilab
A toolbox for internal fluid flow for Scilab</br>
This package provides a set of functions 
designed to solve problems of internal fluid flow 
on Scilab under GNU GPLv3. All functions are based 
on the Colebrooke-White equation for turbulent flow, 
the Poiseuille condition for laminar flow, 
and the Darcy-Weissbach equation for head loss.</br>
Basic functions allow the user to compute either 
the Reynolds number or the Darcy friction factor, 
given one of them is given along with 
the relative roughness.</br>
More advanced functions allow 
to compute both the Reynolds number and 
the Darcy friction factor given the head loss and 
other variables that describe the fluid flow.</br>
Enjoy!
