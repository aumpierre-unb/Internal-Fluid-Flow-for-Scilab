Description: This package provides a set of functions
 designed to solve problems of internal fluid flow
 on Scilab under GNU GPLv3.
 All functions are based on
 the Poiseuille condition for laminar flow,
 the Colebrook-White equation for turbulent flow, and
 the Darcy-Weisbach equation for head loss.
 Basic functions allow to compute either
 the Reynolds number or the Darcy friction factor,
 given one of them is given along with the relative roughness.
 More advanced functions allow to compute
 both the Reynolds number and the Darcy friction factor
 given the head loss and other variables
 that describe the fluid flow.
