Description: This package provides a set of functions designed to solve problems of internal fluid flow on Scilab under GNU GPLv3. All functions are based on the Poiseuille condition for laminar flow, the Colebrooke-White equation for turbulent flow, and the Darcy-Weisbach equation for head loss. Basic functions allow to compute either the Reynolds number or the Darcy friction factor, given one of them is given along with the relative roughness. More advanced functions allow to compute both the Reynolds number and the Darcy friction factor given the head loss and other variables that describe the fluid flow. Enjoy!
